      <h1>Polytheism: Baby Dionysus and Hermes</h1>
    <img src="images/dionysus.jpg" alt="a photo of hermes holding baby dionysus">
    <p>Dionysus was a god born in wine.  Known for being the god of partying, celebration, love - and more erotic experiences - he was quite popular.  Many cults in ancient greek society - and I daresay modern - were built around Dionysus.  This particular statue shows the god Hermes holding a baby Dionysus.</p>
      <p>The primitive dynamism of Dionysus was juxtaposed to the rationale and orderly god Apollo by the philosopher Nietszche.  The philosopher's hope was to encourage the embracement of a modern Dionysus-like mind as the time had come for a revolution of values and reigning ideas inhereted from the Apollonian-like religions. </p>
      <p>There are three good reasons to adopt a Dionysian mind:</p>

            <li>Lots of wine,</li>
